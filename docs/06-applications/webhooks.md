The Platformer Console can be plugged into any CI pipeline using [Image Collections](/05-integrations/image-collections) and [Container Registry Integrations](/05-integrations/container-registry-integration).

If you haven't used an existing Image Collection for your Application Containers, you can plug your CI pipeline in from the Application itself.

- The **Webhook Builder** for the Application can be found in **Application Overview** > **Webhooks** tab.
