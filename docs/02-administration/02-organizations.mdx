When you sign-up for the very first time, the Platformer Console automatically creates a **Personal Workspace** for you.

> Your Personal Workspace is ideal for your own projects that are NOT shared across a team or an organization. If you wish to continue with the Personal Workspace you can skip this section and [start configuring a Project](./projects) in your personal workspace.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, it's important to understand the resource hierarchies and relationships with key resources involved in deploying applications on Kubernets using the Platformer Console.
[Read about these concepts](./resource-hierachies)

## Creating your Organization

<Tabs
  defaultValue="console"
  values={[
    {label: 'Console', value: 'console'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="console">

1. Open the Platformer Console <a href="https://beta.console.platformer.com/" target="_">(Open in a new tab)</a>

2. From the Admin Panel select **+ CREATE ORGANIZATION**

3. Fill in the following mandatory* values
  - Organization Name*
  - Organization Address
  - Country*
  - Organization Domain Name* (note you will need to verify this domain in a later step)
> You can optionally use a *custom domain* if you do not own an domain and skip the domain verification steps below.
  - Support Email* (an email where Platformer staff can contact you if required)

4. Click Continue

5. At this stage you need to verify that you own the domain name.
  - Copy the TXT record data and verify that you or your Organization owns the domain
  - If you decide to verify it later, please copy the TXT record.

6. Click Finish - Your organization will be created and set up on the Platformer Console.*

:::note
Please note that **unless you have verified the domain name, you will not be able to create projects under this Organization**. This is a security measure to ensure that no 3rd-party or unauthorized user can create an Organization under your domain.
