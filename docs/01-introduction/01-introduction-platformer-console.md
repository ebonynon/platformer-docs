The Platformer Console is a hassle-free enterprise-grade application platform to simplify and streamline your Kubernetes experience on Cloud, Hybrid, On-Premise or Edge Infrastructure.

**The Platformer Console was built with three primary objectives in mind.**

-   To enable you to centrally manage the deployment and configuration of containerized apps.
-   To accelerate development cycles by enabling developers and operations to work together in a Kubernetes environment.
-   To allow you to develop apps for vendor-neutral Kubernetes in a provider agnostic manner.
